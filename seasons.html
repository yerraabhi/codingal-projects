        <h1>Seasons of India</h1>
        <p>India has 4 seasons and we will learn about all of them. </p>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Winter</li></h3>
            <p>The winter season in India generally spans from December to February, with January often being the coldest month. While
            the northern regions experience colder temperatures, including potential snowfall in the Himalayas, the southern parts
            of India generally enjoy milder winters.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Summer</li>
            </h3>
            <p>In India, the summer season typically spans from March to June, with the hottest months being May and June. This period
            is characterized by high temperatures, low humidity, and the potential for heat waves, especially in the northern and
            central regions. The sun's rays are nearly vertical during this time, causing the midday heat to be intense.</p>

                <h3>
                    <li>Monsoon</li>
                </h3>
                <p>The rainy season in India, also known as the monsoon season, typically lasts from June to September. During this period,
                India receives the majority of its annual rainfall, with the southwest monsoon bringing moisture-laden winds from the
                ocean to the land.</p>

                    <h3>
                        <li>Autumn</li>
                    </h3>
                    <p>Autumn in India, also known as Sharad Ritu, generally falls between October and November. This season follows the
                    monsoon and precedes winter, characterized by pleasant, cooler temperatures, clear skies, and vibrant foliage as trees
                    begin to shed their leaves. The monsoon rains have subsided, leaving behind fresh, crisp air.</p>
